# Contributing

All pull requests require a corresponding issue opened and discussed before any code is written.

## Process

1. Open an issue describing the problem you've identified
2. Wait for maintainer response and agreement that the problem needs solving
3. If approved, discuss the approach before implementing
4. Submit PR only after steps 1-3 are complete

## What doesn't need an issue

Nothing. If you think something needs changing, open an issue first.

## PR requirements

- Reference the issue number in the PR description
- PRs without a pre-existing, approved issue will be closed immediately
- Typo fixes, formatting changes, and dependency updates are not accepted

## Response time

Issues and PRs are reviewed when maintainers have time. Pinging or bumping will deprioritize your request.
